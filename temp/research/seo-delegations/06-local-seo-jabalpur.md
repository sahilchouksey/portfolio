# Local SEO Strategy - Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh (AI Engineer Portfolio)

## Objective
Build qualified local demand for "AI engineer in Jabalpur / Madhya Pradesh" while preserving credibility for national and remote clients.

---

## 1) Google Business Profile (GBP) Viability

### Verdict
**Conditionally viable** for this business model, but only if operational reality matches Google policy.

### Eligibility assessment for an AI engineer
- **Viable** if you provide in-person services to clients (consulting meetings, workshops, implementation sessions) in Jabalpur/MP and can define real business hours.
- **Viable (Service Area Business)** if you work from home but serve clients at their locations; hide exact address and set service areas.
- **Not viable / high suspension risk** if the business is purely online with no real local service presence or if address/phone details are not genuine.

### Recommended GBP setup (if eligible)
- Primary category: `Software Company` or `Computer Consultant` (choose the closest fit to actual service delivery).
- Secondary categories: `Consultant`, `Business Development Service` (only if truly applicable).
- Business name: personal brand + role (no keyword stuffing).
- Address: use only if compliant; otherwise use service-area mode and hide address.
- Service areas: Jabalpur + selected MP districts where you can genuinely serve.
- Photos: professional headshot, workspace, speaking/workshop photos, project screenshots.
- Services section: RAG development, AI workflow automation, LLM app engineering, healthcare AI integration.
- Q&A seed entries: response time, project types, engagement model, industries served.

### GBP risk controls
- Use one business profile only.
- Keep business name, phone, and website identical to site NAP.
- Avoid virtual office/coworking addresses unless permanently staffed and policy-compliant.
- Do not incentivize reviews; request authentic client feedback post-delivery.

## 2) Local Citations + NAP Consistency Plan

## NAP standard (single source of truth)
Create a canonical NAP block and reuse everywhere:
- **Name:** Sahil Chouksey (or final brand format, exactly one version)
- **Address format:** Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India (or full address if policy-compliant and public)
- **Phone:** one primary number in E.164 format (`+91...`)
- **Website:** one canonical URL (https, trailing slash convention fixed)
- **Email:** one public contact email

Store this in a single internal doc and use copy-paste exact values for all listings.

### Priority citation stack (India + global)
1. Google Business Profile (if eligible)
2. Bing Places
3. Apple Business Connect
4. Justdial
5. Sulekha
6. IndiaMART (if service model fits B2B lead-gen)
7. Clutch (IT/consulting profile)
8. GoodFirms
9. Crunchbase (entity corroboration)
10. LinkedIn company/personal services section
11. GitHub profile + website field
12. Relevant local chambers/startup directories in MP/Jabalpur

### Citation execution SOP
- Use identical NAP and same homepage URL in every listing.
- Add short, unique 80-120 word description per platform (avoid duplicate text spam).
- Match categories to AI/software consulting intent.
- Track every listing in a sheet with: URL, login owner, status, last updated date.
- Quarterly audit: fix duplicates, merge inconsistent entries, update stale data.

### NAP consistency QA checklist
- Name spelling and punctuation exactly same.
- No mixed city labels (Jabalpur vs nearby city variants) unless in service area field.
- No alternate phone numbers across listings unless intentionally added as secondary.
- Same logo/headshot across major platforms.
- Add `LocalBusiness`/`ProfessionalService` schema only after visible NAP is finalized.
