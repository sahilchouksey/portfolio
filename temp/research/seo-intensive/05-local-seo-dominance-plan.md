# Local SEO Dominance Plan (Jabalpur + Madhya Pradesh + India)

## Objective
Build search dominance for an **individual engineer brand** by layering geo-targeting from:
1. **City intent:** Jabalpur
2. **State intent:** Madhya Pradesh
3. **National intent:** India

Primary business outcome: increase qualified inbound leads (calls, WhatsApp, form submissions, email) from service pages and local landing pages.

## Strategic Positioning for an Individual Engineer Brand

### Brand Positioning Statement
Use a clear positioning formula across pages and profiles:

**[Name], Engineer in Jabalpur helping [client type] with [service outcomes] across Madhya Pradesh and India.**

Example:
- "I’m a software engineer in Jabalpur helping startups and SMEs build web apps, automation systems, and performance-focused websites across Madhya Pradesh and India."

### Core Entity Signals to Standardize Everywhere
Keep these exact across all properties (website, directories, profiles):
- Full name (brand owner)
- Brand descriptor (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Civil Engineer", etc.)
- Primary category/service keywords
- Phone (single canonical number)
- Email (single canonical business email)
- Website URL
- Primary service area: Jabalpur
- Secondary service area: Madhya Pradesh
- Expanded service area: India (remote)

This consistency is critical for citation trust and local ranking stability.
