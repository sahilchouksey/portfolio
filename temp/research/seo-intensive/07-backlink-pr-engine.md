# White-Hat Backlink + Digital PR Engine for a Solo AI Engineer Portfolio

## Objective
Build a repeatable, white-hat off-page growth system that increases qualified referring domains, improves authority to commercial-intent portfolio pages, and compounds brand search over 6-12 months.

## Ground Rules (White-Hat)
- No paid links, PBNs, link exchanges at scale, or manipulative anchor stuffing.
- Prioritize editorial relevance, topical fit, and audience overlap over raw DR.
- Use a 70/20/10 mix: evergreen assets (70%), reactive PR (20%), experiments (10%).
- Track outcomes by qualified referrals + assisted conversions, not only link counts.

## Portfolio Page Priorities (Authority Destinations)
Assume these priority pages:
- `/` (homepage + positioning)
- `/projects/ai-automation-case-studies`
- `/services/ai-consulting`
- `/blog/` (hub)
- `/about`
- `/contact`

## 12-Month Outcome Targets (Realistic for Solo Operator)
- Referring domains (new, qualified): 90-140 total (avg 8-12/month).
- High-authority placements (DR70+ or equivalent editorial trust): 12-24/year.
- Mid-tier relevant placements (DR40-69): 48-72/year.
- Niche placements (DR20-39, highly relevant): 30-45/year.
- Branded search demand: +30-60% by month 12.
- Assisted leads from referral + brand pathways: 2-6/month by month 12.

## Linkable Asset Ideas (Built for a Solo AI Engineer)
Create small, useful assets that naturally earn mentions.

1. **AI ROI Calculator (interactive)**
   - Angle: estimate hours/cost savings from automating specific workflows.
   - Best for: SaaS blogs, ops communities, consultants, newsletters.

2. **State of AI Automation in SMBs (mini-report, quarterly)**
   - Angle: survey + lightweight benchmark data + practical recommendations.
   - Best for: journalists, B2B publications, founder communities.

3. **Prompt Pattern Library for Real Business Tasks**
   - Angle: tested prompts + failure modes + implementation notes.
   - Best for: education blogs, productivity creators, tool directories.

4. **Open Source Utility (small but useful)**
   - Examples: lead enrichment script, LLM eval harness, agent reliability checker.
   - Best for: GitHub ecosystem links, dev newsletters, docs mentions.

5. **Case Study Teardowns (public, reproducible)**
   - Angle: before/after metrics, architecture diagrams, constraints.
   - Best for: niche communities, consultant roundups, industry media.

6. **AI Tool Comparison Matrix (regularly refreshed)**
   - Angle: practical comparison by use case, risk, and implementation effort.
   - Best for: roundups, affiliate-free editorial references, resource pages.

## Digital PR Story Framework
Use one story per month with a data hook.

- **Story formula**: Trend + proprietary mini-data + practical implication + contrarian insight.
- **Example hooks**:
  - “SMBs overestimate AI implementation time by 2.3x.”
  - “Most AI automations fail at handoff, not model quality.”
  - “Single-operator AI stacks can outperform agencies on speed-to-value.”

### PR Cadence
- Week 1: gather dataset + validate narrative.
- Week 2: publish source content on your site.
- Week 3: pitch journalists/newsletters/podcasters.
- Week 4: repurpose into social thread + LinkedIn + community post.

## Outreach System (Solo-Friendly)
### Prospect Buckets
- Tier A: high authority + high topical relevance.
- Tier B: medium authority + high relevance.
- Tier C: low authority but niche audience relevance.

### Qualification Criteria
- Relevance to AI implementation, automation, engineering, productivity, SaaS operations.
- Signs of editorial quality (named author, original content, recent updates).
- Existing pages that can naturally cite your specific asset.

### Weekly Workflow
- Monday: build 30-50 prospects.
- Tuesday: personalize and send first-touch outreach.
- Thursday: follow-up #1.
- Next Tuesday: follow-up #2.
- Friday: record wins, anchor distribution, and page-level authority impact.

## Anchor Text and Destination Strategy
- 60-70% branded/naked URL anchors.
- 20-30% partial-match topical anchors.
- 5-10% exact-ish anchors only when editorially natural.
- Deep-link ratio target: 65-75% to internal priority pages, remainder to homepage/assets.

## Authority Transfer Mapping (Priority Pages)
Use links to assets as entry points, then distribute internal authority intentionally.

| External Link Source Type | Primary Linked Asset/Page | Internal Links From That Page | Final Authority Destination | Suggested Anchor Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data PR coverage | `/blog/state-of-ai-automation-report` | Link to `/services/ai-consulting`, `/projects/ai-automation-case-studies` | Service + case studies | Brand + partial topical |
| Resource pages | `/tools/ai-roi-calculator` | Link to `/services/ai-consulting`, `/contact` | Service + conversion page | Tool name + brand |
| Dev newsletters/docs | `/open-source/[tool-name]` | Link to `/projects/ai-automation-case-studies`, `/about` | Case studies + expertise page | Branded / URL |
| Podcast show notes | `/about` or homepage | Link to `/services/ai-consulting`, top case study | Service + trust pages | Brand/person name |
| Guest expert article | Relevant blog post | Link to service/case study cluster | Commercial + proof pages | Partial topical + brand |

## Internal Linking Rules to Maximize Transfer
- Every linkable asset must link to 2-3 money pages within first 30-40% of content.
- Add contextual links (not boilerplate blocks) using naturally descriptive anchors.
- Keep click depth low: priority pages should be <=2 clicks from homepage.
- Refresh old assets quarterly to maintain crawl frequency and freshness.

## KPIs and Dashboard (Track Monthly)
- New referring domains (qualified vs unqualified).
- Follow/nofollow mix (healthy blend, not forced).
- Links by destination page (avoid homepage-only concentration).
- Assisted conversions by first-touch source (referral, organic brand, direct).
- Brand mentions without links (convert to link reclamation list).
- Outreach funnel: sent -> opened -> replied -> placed.

## Tool Stack (Lean)
- Prospecting: Ahrefs/Semrush + manual SERP checks.
- Outreach: Gmail + lightweight CRM sheet or Notion database.
- PR discovery: Featured/Help a B2B Writer/PressPulse-type request feeds.
- Monitoring: Google Search Console + Ahrefs alerts + brand mention alerts.

## 30-60-90 Day Execution Plan
### Days 1-30
- Publish 2 foundational assets (calculator + one data post).
- Build first 150 qualified prospects.
- Send first 100 outreach emails.
- Land first 5-8 placements.

### Days 31-60
- Publish 2 more assets (open-source utility + case study teardown).
- Launch first digital PR story with custom data angle.
- Send 120-160 outreach emails.
- Land 8-10 placements.

### Days 61-90
- Refresh best-performing asset and repitch with new angle.
- Expand into podcasts/newsletters and expert quotes.
- Send 150+ outreach emails.
- Land 10-12 placements and improve deep-link distribution to priority pages.

## Risk Controls
- Avoid over-optimizing anchors to a single commercial keyword.
- Diversify source types to avoid footprint patterns.
- Reject irrelevant placements even if authority is high.
- Maintain editorial quality on your own site so earned links retain value.

## What “Good” Looks Like After 6 Months
- 45-60 new qualified referring domains.
- 2-4 recurring editorial relationships producing repeat mentions.
- 2 assets responsible for 60%+ of link acquisition.
- Priority service/case pages gaining rankings and assisted leads.
- Outreach playbook repeatable in 4-6 focused hours/week.

## Suggested Monthly Cadence (Solo Time Budget)
- 4-6 hrs/week total:
  - 2 hrs prospecting + personalization
  - 1.5 hrs outreach + follow-ups
  - 1.5 hrs asset improvement and repurposing
  - 1 hr reporting + pipeline cleanup

This engine is intentionally conservative, compounding, and execution-friendly for one operator.
